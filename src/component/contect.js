            <p> Paraphrasing is the act of putting someone else’s idea or writing in different words. You might use paraphrasing to clearly convey a concept or integrate another person’s ideas into an article or paper; you’ll also need to cite your source when including paraphrased text in your written work.

No matter what you want to reword or why, the easiest, fastest way to paraphrase is to use a free paraphrasing tool like the one at the top of this page.
